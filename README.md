# This is identical to Octoprint's built-in GCode Viewer with a few tiny changes
* Changed name of plugin from 'gcodeviewer' to 'cnc_gcodeviewer' to prevent collisions and naming conflicts
* Added understanding of G00 and G01 which are generated by some CAM tools (but generally not by slicers)
* Keeps track of the lowest Z value that has occurred
* When tool is at the lowest Z value, it is considered "extruding", otherwise it is "not extruding"

 Installing
* (Optional) disable the default gcode viewer plugin (disable is okay, no need to uninstall)
* Install plugin like any other plugin, no special considerations
